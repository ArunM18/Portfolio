This script calculates the daily Value at Risk (VaR) for a user-defined portfolio of FTSE 100 stocks. It connects to a local SQLite database (ftse100yr_to_date.db) to retrieve historical stock prices. The database contains the closing prices of every FTSE 100 stock over the passed year. Users are prompted to select stocks from the FTSE 100, specify investment amounts, and set a confidence level between 0.75 and 1. The script then computes the VaR using both historical data and Monte Carlo simulation methods. It outputs the VaR results and displays histograms of the profit and loss distributions, highlighting the calculated VaR values. To use the script, ensure that the ftse100yr_to_date.db database file is in the same directory and that the required Python libraries (sqlite3, matplotlib, and numpy) are installed. Run the script, follow the prompts to input your portfolio details, and view the calculated VaR and generated plots.

**Example Figure:** 'Example Outputs.png' shows the script calculating VaR (at a 0.99 confidence level) for 4 stocks with investment amounts as follows: Tesco Plc (£100,000); Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (£50,000); Unilever Plc (£75,000) and National Grid Plc (£25,000).
